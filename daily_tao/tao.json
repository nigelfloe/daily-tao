Close your mouth,\r\nblock off your senses,\r\nblunt your sharpness,\r\nuntie your knots,\r\nsoften your glare,\r\nsettle your dust.\r\nThis is the primal identity. Be like the Tao.\r\nIt can't be approached or withdrawn from,\r\nbenefited or harmed,\r\nhonored or brought into disgrace.\r\nIt gives itself up continually.\r\nThat is why it endures.",
    "57": "57\r\n\r\nIf you want to be a great leader,\r\nyou must learn to follow the Tao.\r\nStop trying to control.\r\nLet go of fixed plans and concepts,\r\nand the world will govern itself. The more prohibitions you have,\r\nthe less virtuous people will be.\r\nThe more weapons you have,\r\nthe less secure people will be.\r\nThe more subsidies you have,\r\nthe less self-reliant people will be. Therefore the Master says:\r\nI let go of the law,\r\nand people become honest.\r\nI let go of economics,\r\nand people become prosperous.\r\nI let go of religion,\r\nand people become serene.\r\nI let go of all desire for the common good,\r\nand the good becomes common as grass.",
    "58": "58\r\n\r\nIf a country is governed with tolerance,\r\nthe people are comfortable and honest.\r\nIf a country is governed with repression,\r\nthe people are depressed and crafty. When the will to power is in charge,\r\nthe higher the ideals, the lower the results.\r\nTry to make people happy,\r\nand you lay the groundwork for misery.\r\nTry to make people moral,\r\nand you lay the groundwork for vice. Thus the Master is content\r\nto serve as an example\r\nand not to impose her will.\r\nShe is pointed, but doesn't pierce.\r\nStraightforward, but supple.\r\nRadiant, but easy on the eyes.",
    "59": "59\r\n\r\nFor governing a country well\r\nthere is nothing better than moderation. The mark of a moderate man\r\nis freedom from his own ideas.\r\nTolerant like the sky,\r\nall-pervading like sunlight,\r\nfirm like a mountain,\r\nsupple like a tree in the wind,\r\nhe has no destination in view\r\nand makes use of anything\r\nlife happens to bring his way. Nothing is impossible for him.\r\nBecause he has let go,\r\nhe can care for the people's welfare\r\nas a mother cares for her child.",
    "6": "6\r\n\r\nThe Tao is called the Great Mother:\r\nempty yet inexhaustible,\r\nit gives birth to infinite worlds. It is always present within you.\r\nYou can use it any way you want.",
    "60": "60\r\n\r\nGoverning a large country\r\nis like frying a small fish.\r\nYou spoil it with too much poking. Center your country in the Tao\r\nand evil will have no power.\r\nNot that it isn't there,\r\nbut you'll be able to step out of its way. Give evil nothing to oppose\r\nand it will disappear by itself.",
    "61": "61\r\n\r\nWhen a country obtains great power,\r\nit becomes like the sea:\r\nall streams run downward into it.\r\nThe more powerful it grows,\r\nthe greater the need for humility.\r\nHumility means trusting the Tao,\r\nthus never needing to be defensive. A great nation is like a great man:\r\nWhen he makes a mistake, he realizes it.\r\nHaving realized it, he admits it.\r\nHaving admitted it, he corrects it.\r\nHe considers those who point out his faults\r\nas his most benevolent teachers.\r\nHe thinks of his enemy\r\nas the shadow that he himself casts. If a nation is centered in the Tao,\r\nif it nourishes its own people\r\nand doesn't meddle in the affairs of others,\r\nit will be a light to all nations in the world.",
    "62": "62\r\n\r\nThe Tao is the center of the universe,\r\nthe good man's treasure,\r\nthe bad man's refuge. Honors can be bought with fine words,\r\nrespect can be won with good deeds;\r\nbut the Tao is beyond all value,\r\nand no one can achieve it. Thus, when a new leader is chosen,\r\ndon't offer to help him\r\nwith your wealth or your expertise.\r\nOffer instead\r\nto teach him about the Tao. Why did the ancient Masters esteem the Tao?\r\nBecause, being one with the Tao,\r\nwhen you seek, you find;\r\nand when you make a mistake, you are forgiven.\r\nThat is why everybody loves it.",
    "63": "63\r\n\r\nAct without doing;\r\nwork without effort.\r\nThink of the small as large\r\nand the few as many.\r\nConfront the difficult\r\nwhile it is still easy;\r\naccomplish the great task\r\nby a series of small acts. The Master never reaches for the great;\r\nthus she achieves greatness.\r\nWhen she runs into a difficulty,\r\nshe stops and gives herself to it.\r\nShe doesn't cling to her own comfort;\r\nthus problems are no problem for her.",
    "64": "64\r\n\r\nWhat is rooted is easy to nourish.\r\nWhat is recent is easy to correct.\r\nWhat is brittle is easy to break.\r\nWhat is small is easy to scatter. Prevent trouble before it arises.\r\nPut things in order before they exist.\r\nThe giant pine tree\r\ngrows from a tiny sprout.\r\nThe journey of a thousand miles\r\nstarts from beneath your feet. Rushing into action, you fail.\r\nTrying to grasp things, you lose them.\r\nForcing a project to completion,\r\nyou ruin what was almost ripe. Therefore the Master takes action\r\nby letting things take their course.\r\nHe remains as calm\r\nat the end as at the beginning.\r\nHe has nothing,\r\nthus has nothing to lose.\r\nWhat he desires is non-desire;\r\nwhat he learns is to unlearn.\r\nHe simply reminds people\r\nof who they have always been.\r\nHe cares about nothing but the Tao.\r\nThus he can care for all things.",
    "65": "65\r\n\r\nThe ancient Masters\r\ndidn't try to educate the people,\r\nbut kindly taught them to not-know. When they think that they know the answers,\r\n\r\npeople are difficult to guide.\r\nWhen they know that they don't know,\r\npeople can find their own way. If you want to learn how to govern,\r\navoid being clever or rich.\r\nThe simplest pattern is the clearest.\r\nContent with an ordinary life,\r\nyou can show all people the way\r\nback to their own true nature.",
    "66": "66\r\n\r\nAll streams flow to the sea\r\nbecause it is lower than they are.\r\nHumility gives it its power. If you want to govern the people,\r\nyou must place yourself below them.\r\nIf you want to lead the people,\r\nyou must learn how to follow them. The Master is above the people,\r\nand no one feels oppressed.\r\nShe goes ahead of the people,\r\nand no one feels manipulated.\r\nThe whole world is grateful to her.\r\nBecause she competes with no one,\r\nno one can compete with her.",
    "67": "67\r\n\r\nSome say that my teaching is nonsense.\r\nOthers call it lofty but impractical.\r\nBut to those who have looked inside themselves,\r\nthis nonsense makes perfect sense.\r\nAnd to those who put it into practice,\r\nthis loftiness has roots that go deep. I have just three things to teach:\r\nsimplicity, patience, compassion.\r\nThese three are your greatest treasures.\r\nSimple in actions and in thoughts,\r\nyou return to the source of being.\r\nPatient with both friends and enemies,\r\nyou accord with the way things are.\r\nCompassionate toward yourself,\r\nyou reconcile all beings in the world.",
    "68": "68\r\n\r\nThe best athlete\r\nwants his opponent at his best.\r\nThe best general\r\nenters the mind of his enemy.\r\nThe best businessman\r\nserves the communal good.\r\nThe best leader\r\nfollows the will of the people. All of the embody\r\nthe virtue of non-competition.\r\nNot that they don't love to compete,\r\nbut they do it in the spirit of play.\r\nIn this they are like children\r\nand in harmony with the Tao.",
    "69": "69\r\n\r\nThe generals have a saying:\r\n\"Rather than make the first move\r\nit is better to wait and see.\r\nRather than advance an inch\r\nit is better to retreat a yard.\" This is called\r\ngoing forward without advancing,\r\npushing back without using weapons. There is no greater misfortune\r\nthan underestimating your enemy.\r\nUnderestimating your enemy\r\nmeans thinking that he is evil.\r\nThus you destroy your three treasures\r\nand become an enemy yourself. When two great forces oppose each other,\r\nthe victory will go\r\nto the one that knows how to yield.",
    "7": "7\r\n\r\nThe Tao is infinite, eternal.\r\nWhy is it eternal?\r\nIt was never born;\r\nthus it can never die.\r\nWhy is it infinite?\r\nIt has no desires for itself;\r\nthus it is present for all beings. The Master stays behind;\r\nthat is why she is ahead.\r\nShe is detached from all things;\r\nthat is why she is one with them.\r\nBecause she has let go of herself,\r\nshe is perfectly fulfilled.",
    "70": "70\r\n\r\nMy teachings are easy to understand\r\nand easy to put into practice.\r\nYet your intellect will never grasp them,\r\nand if you try to practice them, you'll fail.

    "71": "71\r\n\r\nNot-knowing is true knowledge.\r\nPresuming to know is a disease.\r\nFirst realize that you are sick;\r\nthen you can move toward health. The Master is her own physician.\r\nShe has healed herself of all knowing.\r\nThus she is truly whole.",
    "72": "72\r\n\r\nWhen they lose their sense of awe,\r\npeople turn to religion.\r\nWhen they no longer trust themselves,\r\nthey begin to depend upon authority.

    "74": "74\r\n\r\nIf you realize that all things change,\r\nthere is nothing you will try to hold on to.\r\nIf you aren't afraid of dying,\r\nthere is nothing you can't achieve.

    "76": "76\r\n\r\nMen are born soft and supple;\r\ndead, they are stiff and hard.\r\nPlats are born tender and pliant;\r\ndead, they are brittle and dry.

    "77": "77\r\n\r\nAs it acts in the world, the Tao\r\nis like the bending of a bow.\r\nThe top is bent downward;\r\nthe bottom is bent up.\r\nIt adjusts excess and deficiency\r\nso that there is perfect balance.\r\nIt takes from what is too much\r\nand give to what isn't enough. Those who try to control,\r\nwho use force to protect their power,\r\ngo against the direction of the Tao.\r\nThey take from those who don't have enough\r\nand give to those who have far too much. The Master can keep giving\r\nbecause there is no end to her wealth.\r\nShe acts without expectation,\r\nsucceeds without taking credit,\r\nand doesn't think that she is better\r\nthan anyone else.",
    "78": "78\r\n\r\nNothing in the world\r\nis as soft and yielding as water.\r\nYet for dissolving the hard and inflexible,\r\nnothing can surpass it.

Therefore the Master remains\r\nserene in the midst of sorrow.\r\nEvil cannot enter his heart.\r\nBecause he has given up helping,\r\nhe is people's greatest help. True words seem paradoxical.",
    "79": "79\r\n\r\nFailure is an opportunity.\r\nIf you blame someone else,\r\nthere is no end to the blame. Therefore the Master\r\nfulfills her own obligations\r\nand corrects her own mistakes.\r\nShe does what she needs to do\r\nand demands nothing of others.",
    "8": "8\r\n\r\nThe supreme good is like water,\r\nwhich nourishes all things without trying to.\r\nIt is content with the low places that people disdain.\r\nThus it is like the Tao.
